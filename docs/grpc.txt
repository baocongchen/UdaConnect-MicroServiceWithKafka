1/ To retrieve Location data
- Execute `kubectl get pod` to look up the name of location-consumer pod
- Execute `kubectl exec location-consumer-someHashString -- python3 getter.py 29` (29 is location id; replace 29 with an id of a location you want to retrieve)

2/ To create Location data
- Execute `kubectl get pod` to look up the name of location-producer pod,
- Execute `kubectl exec location-producer-someHashString -- python3 writer.py` (you can make changes in request data in write.py to add different Location data to DB)
